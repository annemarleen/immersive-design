## Health Adverse Effects

Vection: a feeling that you are moving even though you are immobile, brought on by seeing something else moving. It can be dangerous if it for instance leads astronauts to misinterpret the direction and speed of other objects. Also in VR, it can cause health adverse effects.

Minimizing Motion Sickness, some focus points:
* Vignetting: for shrinking the field of view during locomotion
* Judder: motion to photon latency
* Fatigue: graphics, sound, wearing headset, strenuous activity

## VR Optics & Displays

![Optics VR](http://ieeevr.org/2016/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VR2016-0290-file3.jpg)

The primary subject of virtual reality is simulating the vision. Every headset aims to perfect their approach to creating an immersive 3D environment. Each VR headset puts up a screen (or two - one for each eye) in front of eyes thus, eliminating any interaction with the real world. Two autofocus lenses are generally placed between the screen and the eyes that adjust based on individual eye movement and positioning. The visuals on the screen are rendered either by using a mobile phone or HDMI cable connected to a PC.

*"Because these places were filmed with a high-resolution prototype camera that reproduces some of the key cues we use to understand depth in the real world, it felt more like actually being there than anything I’ve experienced with any other live-action VR. Which is to say it was pretty damn cool."* - Google's light field technology

### CAVE

*CAVE2*

The CAVE® is a multi-person, room-sized, high-resolution 3D video and audio environment invented at EVL in 1991. Graphics are projected in stereo onto three walls and the floor, and viewed with active stereo glasses equipped with a location sensor. As the user moves within the display boundaries, the correct perspective is displayed in real-time to achieve a fully immersive experience. 

In the early 1990s, Daniel Sandin, along with his colleagues Thomas DeFanti and Carolina Cruz-Neira, developed the CAVE System (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) to project interactive, computer-generated 3-D imagery and audio into a physical space defined by multiple projection screens and a surround-sound system. The immersive nature of CAVE was intended as an allusion to Plato's Cave, evoking the shadowy presence of the representation of reality. The CAVE System also returns full circle to the earliest attempts at virtualization and multisensory experience, as practiced in the prehistoric caves of Lascaux, seventeen thousand years earlier.

## Gesture Recognition

### Sensor Based Gesture Recognition

![taclim shoes](https://taclim.cerevo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/taclim_main_973.png)

Sensor based gesture recognition is achieved by the use of input devices which utilize accelerometers, gyroscopes and various other micro-electro-mechanical systems for movement measurement and processing. These sensors control and improve the acceleration along three axes as well as improve the rotating movements of the objects in a virtual environment. These sensors are oft accompanied by illumination and optical proximity sensors. [AudioCubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lQNnTG6Lzc), Wii Remotes, [Taclim shoes VR](https://taclim.cerevo.com/en/) or the [Myo armband’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te1RBQQlHz4) are examples of applications which make use of sensor based gesture recognition.

### Glove Based Gesture Recognition
Glove based gesture recognition is the implementation of this technology which makes use of a glove-like device very commonly made use of in virtual reality environments. The gloves, wired with multiple inertial as well as magnetic tracking devices can provide data input to a computer about the rotation motion and the position of the hands. These gloves can even detect the bending of fingers to a high accuracy for close replication of hand movements.

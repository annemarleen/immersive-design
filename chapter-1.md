## The Future of Storytelling in VR

![Roodkapje](http://www.billfrymire.com/gallery/weblarge/red-riding-hood-wolf-bed.jpg)

*Once upon a time.........in a charming village on the edge of a dark, twisted forest, Little Red Riding Hood was preparing to visit her ill grandmother. She opened her cupboard and took out:*
1) *The basket of apples,* 
2) *Some freshly cut flowers,* 
3) *Pepper spray,* 
4) *A Samurai sword and set off on her way.*

#### [ article 1: Get a first glimpse into the Future of Storytelling in VR](https://www.pebblestudios.co.uk/2017/01/13/storytelling-in-vr-how-vr-turned-red-riding-hood-into-a-samurai/)

Of course, we all know this isn’t how the story goes. Yet, with the advent of VR and immersive storytelling, the linear narrative is on its way out. We no longer want to just witness the story and watch as Red skips happily and obliviously along the path picking flowers for her grandmother. We want the option to intervene – to pick up that sword and carve our own way through the narrative, Samurai style.

### How to Start Telling Stories

Storytelling does not happen overnight. It takes quite some effort and technique to get to the right story at the right moment for the right person. And with creating storytelling VR or AR, the challenge is even harder since the stories can be told in a multidimensional space, using a variety of points of view within a limited area and degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, here is a basic setup to get you started with Storytelling in VR. Think Visually and use [prototyping techniques](https://medium.com/stanford-d-school/the-storyteller-s-guide-to-the-virtual-reality-audience-19e92da57497)!!

1. Start with your message and goals (think backwards & who, what, where, when, how, why)
2. Know your audience & users (communicate & resonate)
3. Know special needs for [special target groups](https://youtu.be/DgDR_gYk_a8)
4. Taxonomy of Serious Games: [define the type of experience](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis_Encarnacao2/publication/257921847/figure/tbl1/AS:392556530683905@1470604178262/Preliminary-Serious-Games-taxonomy-Sawyer-and-Smith-2008.png)

5. *Syntax* - create Storytelling, Set & Setting ([Periodic Table of Storytelling -Three Act Structure](http://jamesharris.design/periodic/): (sequence & order, cause & effect, problem & solution, compare & contrast)
6. *Semantics* - develop a [Plot](https://youtu.be/wUwr7qJCQhA) (situation, empathy, intentions, character, dialogue, conflict, resolution, call-to-action)
7. *Pragmatics* - translate the plot to 360/VR [(presence, point-of-view, 1st person, 3rd person)](https://vrscout.com/news/writing-vr-definitive-guide-vr-storytelling/#)

8. Define the Environment & [Spatial Immersion](https://youtu.be/W2eTgbyiY_0)
9. Create effective dialogue through [Subtext](https://youtu.be/SZ0fKW5PttM) (emotional & expressive)
10. Define a prominent Style: (naturalism/impressionism)

# Deep Learning on Narrative Techniques

Narrative differences may concern three different grammatical domains: semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. In narrative theory, *semantics* becomes the study of plot, or story; *syntax* becomes the study of discourse, or narrative techniques; and *pragmatics*, an area still relatively unfamiliar to literary critics, becomes the study of narrative as performance.

## Narrative Theory: Marie-Laure Ryan 
Marie-Laure Ryan is a distinguished narrative theorist and independent scholar, who started exploring Cyberculture and its Narrativity in the early '90s. She as written many books & articles of which some you'll find represented below:

## Narrative Theory: Weaving the braid

![Interactive Narrative Structures](https://weixuanzhaosss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/e59bbee78987-161.png)

*‘Each different action of the user creates a different response from the system and consequently generates a different story. In such a system, the generation and presentation of the story would follow the chronological order of its events and reflect the temporal experience of the characters’ (Ryan, 2005).* 

Marie – Laure Ryan lists 9 possible interactive narrative structures: 

1. The Complete graph structure, 
2. The network structure, 
3. The Tree structure, 
4. The Vector with Side Branches, 
5. The Maze structure, 
6. The Directed Network, or Flow Chat, 
7. The Hidden Story structure, 
8. The Braided Plot, 
9. Action Space, Epic Wandering and Story-World.

In terms of building a real time interactive film storyboard, it needs a *dynamic narrative database-based system*. Each of the events is narrative fragment that has logical and consequential coherence that links by nodes. Users can swim in the self-renewable and never-ending narrative pool with a various and diversified series of stories. 

‘The system is able to construct an infinite number of appropriate responses, which means the interactive narrative could create three forms of immersion: 

* Spatial (thanks to the 3D environment), 
* Temporal (the action takes place in real time), 
* Emotional (the user deeply cares for his avatar). 

This type of system could be made interactive by handing over some decisions to the user. The user and the system could take turns generating events, and the story would be the product of their collaboration. The balance of control could be adjusted by giving more turns to the user or to the system. the story world will evolve somewhat randomly, rather than striving toward a global narrative pattern’ (Ryan, 2005).

## Narrative Theory: The Fourth Wall
![Fouth Wall](https://emages.eventshigh.com/2016/8/9/img_fa2c7dc081697217f7fd8ffa5cc3d237_1470747965782_original.jpg)

Breaking the fourth wall was common in Elizabethan theatre, specifically in Shakespeare's works. There is an unparalleled connection between audience and story in VR when a storyteller knows how to manage the medium. An almost visceral reaction can be evoked in audiences when a Director knows how to leverage Virtual Reality to tell his/her story.

When [**Henry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUY2yI5F16U) looks directly at us - in context- in the well made VR film of the same name, there is no denying the feeling of ‘presence’ the audience feels when viewing Henry in VR. However, stil it is needed to respect [Personal Space in VR](http://percept.eecs.yorku.ca/papers/HFES_Paper%20fin.pdf), just as much as it is in real-world situations. Two zones are of most interest (according to Hall(1963): 
* Personal Distance Zone
* Social Distance Zone

## Narrative Theory: Emotional Immersion

Emotions are not easy to grasp and research on Emotions has been done for decades and probably will be. Our aim for this topic is to discuss some influential ladies who design for Emotion in VR. Chapter 10 provides more information in-depth on the research on Emotions. 

### Influencers

[Karen Palmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIpeUdKK2-4) combines Neurogaming, Film, Wearable Technology and Parkour to create dynamic immersive video installations to inspire and empower the user. Her practise involves creating a sense of mindfulness and “being in the moment” to simulate a physiological and spiritual journey through storytelling and technology.

[Maureen Fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvuQqZfZ2d4) is CEO and co-founder of Baobab Studios, the industry's leading VR animation studio. Started in 2015, the company's Emmy-award winning VR animation, INVASION!, starring Ethan Hawke, launched to substantial critical acclaim and become the top performing VR app.


### Writing for Emotion: The Emotion Thesaurus
One of the biggest problem areas for writers is conveying a character's emotions to the reader in a unique, compelling way. The Emotion Thesaurus comes to the rescue by highlighting 75 emotions and listing the possible body language cues, thoughts, and visceral responses for each.

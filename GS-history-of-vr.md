### Today's Designers of VR

![HTC + Valve](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b31ab9e4b0a06c6decaa65/569583bfa128e6805ab8a068/56d91973f850821330661ab5/1457068471677/5D3_0115.jpg?format=1000w)

*"The HTC Vive was designed in collaboration with Valve. As a member of the HTC Vive team, I worked on the design of the system as a whole, with my main responsibility being focused on the design of the controllers.  Each controller packs 24 sensors, which enable the system to accurately track its position based on the two Lighthouse base stations." - Brent Barbarberis* 

[Brent Barbarberis](http://brentbarberis.com/work/#/htc-vive/) (left) has been one of the designers of HTC Vive's controllers. Educated as an Industrial Designer, HTC + Valve provided him the ability to interweave his drawing skills, design thinking quality and knowledge from a variety of expert fields, such as: ergonomics, material design, electronics and prototyping.

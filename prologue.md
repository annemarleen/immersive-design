# Welcome!

This course Immersive Design XR (eXperience Reality) is made for you to start Designing for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) experiences. This course will start with a historical perspective on Simulation & Virtual Reality and show how to build narratives for VR. It will also help you, as a Designer (or interested Developer) to learn what kind of *UX and Interaction Design* methods can be used and it will provide in-depth information and exercises about basic principles, such as *Navigating*, *Wayfinding*, *Attention*, *Animation* and *Feedback*. In order to speed up your learning curve, we have also built in exercises and knowledge about all necessary *hardware & software programs*, so that it will be easier to translate your ideas into *code, interaction and materialisation*. Designing for 3-dimensional experience can be a bit fuzzy in the beginning, but we aim to support your learning process as much as we can.

### Our Vision
Our vision is formed on the premise that future designers will be Immersive Designers, who untie themselves from any device and will place the content in the world itself, eliminating the abstraction between the content and its users as much as possible. Students learn how to design for this abstraction and learn how to create multi-sensory experiences that fully captivate the user's potential to feel & sense, touch & taste, see & move, to listen & to speak, without losing grip on the user's needs for understanding and guidance throughout the experience.

Pygmalion Spectacles (1935) - S. Weinbaum

*”BUT what is reality?" asked the gnomelike man. He gestured at the tall banks of buildings that loomed around Central Park, with their countless windows glowing like the cave fires of a city of Cro-Magnon people. "All is dream, all is illusion; I am your vision as you are mine.”* - Pygmalion Spectacles

**Late 18th & 19th century**
The predominant mode of landscape representation was the [bird’s-eye view](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Jan_Micker_-_Bird%27s_Eye_View_of_Amsterdam_%28ca._1652%29.jpg). This type of image offered the onlooker a high viewpoint outside the subject depicted within the frame of representation, whether a city, a coastline, or a pastoral scene. In the 19th century the [‘panaroma’](http://www.pm360.nl/) evolved; which was a new method of displaying a landscape image. Painted landscapes were exhibited in a 360-degree view, on a circular canvas strip surrounding the viewer. These paintings were intended to fill the viewer’s entire field of vision, making them feel present at some historical event or scene.

**In 1935** Stanley Weinbaum wrote a short story titled [“Pygmalion’s Spectacles”](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0607251h.html). The story was the first depiction of a goggle-based virtual reality system. In it fictional experiences were broken down through holographic recordings incorporating senses like smell and touch.

**Mid 1950s**, Cinematographer Morton Heilig developed the Sensorama (patented 1962), which was an arcade-style theatre cabinet that would stimulate all the senses, not just sight and sound. It featured stereo speakers, a stereoscopic 3D display, fans, smell generators and a vibrating chair. The Sensorama was intended to fully immerse the individual in the film.

[Nathan Joseph](https://medium.com/re-write/from-static-to-dynamic-and-back-to-static-d77f33e8ee61) explains that **in 1968**, the next big jump on the virtual reality spectrum came when Ivan Sutherland created the first Head Mounted Display (HMD), with the help of one of Ivan’s student, Bob Sproull. 

However, throughout this boom in technological development the term “virtual reality” still wasn’t even a part of our collective lexicons. It wasn’t until the 80’s when, Jaron Lanier popularized the term providing us with a newly colored lens to look at the world through. Soon Lanier’s ideas were promoting storylines in popular science fiction television shows like Star Trek. From there, science fiction writers began to delve into the depths of what VR could encompass. Ultimately, bringing their ideas to the silver screen with movies like [Tron (1982)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BZxGhNdz1k "Tron"), [Robocop(1987)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbCbwP6ibR4 "Robocop"), and even the early 2000's hit [The Matrix Trilogy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNnGXXlPzuo "Matrix").
